# IS PHONE FARMING ON ONE DEVICE POSSIBLE? (HOW TO GET STARTED)

Video Guide - [https://youtu.be/Qb7vZO-7MZY](https://youtu.be/Qb7vZO-7MZY)

Hey everyone, it’s Dan from [Sidehustlereliance.com](https://Sidehustlereliance.com). About 6 months ago I uploaded a video showcasing my current android phone farm and how profitable it was. It was interesting to see how others are phone farming. Following on from that I wondered how easy it is for someone to start phone farming themselves. In this post, I will be showing you the best apps and websites to run, on one device. As well as where you can get decent devices for a great price. One thing I need to mention is that there isn’t such thing as a truly passive phone farm, so some work will be required. Anyways let’s get into the full phone farming guide for newbies!

**Purchasing a Phone**

To start with it’s best to look for some ground rules when it comes to the devices. You’d want an android device, which is can run at least Android 9 or above, this way the majority of the applications can run with ease. I normally start on eBay and just see what used phones are available for a good price. I wouldn’t ever spend above £25 ($30 / Euro 30), this way you can get a good ROI even quicker. My favourite phone to use is the moto G5, but sadly these phones do only run up to Android 8. Cost is everything when you’re starting out, and just having a guide on how to much spend on your first phone for your phone farming for you newbies will make a big impact.

**Application 1: Cryptotab**

The first application is Cryptotab, it’s a cloud mining browser and it comes in a Free or Paid version. I suggest using the Free version to start with until you earn enough to purchase the paid version. Simply log in by doing the captcha every 2 hours on the free version to mine some bitcoin for free. It’s not a load of money but it will take you around 7 cents a day ($0.07). It’s an easy way to get into crypto as well as phone farm, and perfect for newbies.

**Application 2: Ember Fund**

Speaking of cloud mining, the next app you should use is called Ember Fund (EF). EF is like a Cryptotab, but more reliable, as you log in every 24 hours and you’ll mine 2.5 satoshis per hour. That means you’ll earn a total of 60 satoshis a day on EF, just sign up and begin mining. You can be estimated to easily earn 4 cents a day, with one check-in!

**Application(s) 3: Peer2Profit & Honeygain (using them on Phone Farming for Newbies Guide)**

The next applications are the data sharing apps known as Peer2Profit and Honeygain. These applications share your data connection with their clients and it’s an easy way to earn passive income. All you do is sign up, install and log in, and you’re earning passively. With Peer2Profit and Honey gain, I make between these two applications I make about $0.50 a day without referrals.

Applications (s) 4: S’mores, Myrobinhood & 101Sweets for Phone Farming Guide

Three of the best applications to Run are S’mores, Myrobinhood and 101Sweets, these are lock screen applications where you simply slide to unlock the app and you gain 10 cents per application (so $0.30 total). Sadly if you’re outside the US you will need to sideload these applications, and then verify your number with a No VOIP phone number, I like using Textverified. One thing to note though. I’ve had several issues creating new accounts on this platform as of the recent update, so I would suggest downloading the app and checking if you get “API unavailable”, if so, uninstall it and don’t waste your time.

**Applications (s) 5: Playtime Rewards for Phone Farming Guide**

It would be rude to not mention Playtime rewards adwall in this guide. This is a way you can play games and earn some easy cash. The best thing about playtime rewards though, it’s passive when you’re earning by playing. I would suggest you sign up to Swagbucks or Cointiply as they pay the highest when it comes to playtime rewards. Only use one of the playtime rewards sites though on your device, as the developers can ban your device ID from the site. The Device IDs can be reset if needed, but it would make that platform unable to be used. Also, if you see the “complete a level to earn xxx points” don’t waste your time with that, but when starting out you should easily be able to make $1.50 a day from this.

**Applications (s) 6: LootTV, HideoutTV and Current Music**

The three next applications I believe should be done in a cycle of 8 hours and only done if you’re not making more than $1 a day from Playtime rewards. I think these three applications are ideal for any newbie to phone farming as it gives you a guide and a lot of structure.

**Loot TV**

Firstly, for the first 8 hours, for example, midnight until 8 am, run Loot TV, this is a site which requires no babysitting and will watch videos for you and reward you for them. If you transfer the points to [Freecash](https://freecash.com/r/76561198042764897), you’ll earn a 1 to 1 ratio, so 1,000 points is a $1. I earn about 35 cents a day with this.

**Hideout TV**

Secondly, once you’re up and have your phone nearby Run [Hideout.tv](https://Hideout.tv) on the device, this is another site that watches videos for you, but every 4 hours you get a captcha asking you to complete it to prove you are watching. This actually pays more than Loot TV if transferred to the get paid to site [LootUp](https://lootup.me/?refer=1759614), as that site allows you to spin a wheel for the chance to win a 50% bonus on your earnings on the site, I have made about $0.50 a day from this site

**Current Music (Mode)**

Finally, for the next 8 hours, I’d suggest running Current Music (now known as Mode). This is a music listening site where you can earn cash by letting music run passively. Every so often you will have to watch an ad, but it’s only every 3 or 4 hours, and you will gain some lost points (up to 30) as well as you’d get points for watching the ads. Another great thing about this application is that you can get cash by charging your device. If you’re cashing out to the $20 Paypal option. Normally 20 points are 1 cent. I make about $0.30 with this application

**Applications (s) 7: Cashpiggy**

One more application I want to mention is the daily check in-app, Cashpiggy. You can check in every 24 hours for an easy 4 cents. Click get “10 free points” and force close. It’s an easy site for newbies to get started on, and you can get started within a few minutes.

**Conclusion on Phone Farming Guide for Newbies**

To conclude, these are the best applications I would run if I was starting a phone farm again. Following this guide as a best-case scenario, you’ll end up with a daily income of $3.6 for this one device, which means you’d end up having an ROI in about 12 days. My phones are only on charge about 8 hours a day. Each phone uses about 0.03 kWh in power, so on one phone, it costs me 5 cents per day. Obviously, energy prices differ depending on your location, so it’s always worth checking your own. I hope this phone farming guide for newbies help you out.
